archetype
==============

**archetype** is a simple archetype system for Node.js.

Archetypes are essentially directories containing a ton of standard files.
Archetype variables are declared with `${varname}`, where `varname` is the name
of the variable that will be replaced in the file.

This module was greatly inspired by Apache Maven. If you do anything on the JVM,
check it out. It's holy.

Usage (terminal)
------------

```
node-arch gen archetype-name project-name --arg1 "My Argument"
```

* `archetype-name` is the name of the archetype you wish to use. This could also be a path to a directory if you specify the `-d` option.
* `project-name` is the name of the project. The directory created is named this. (In the API this is the projectName variable)
* `--var1 "My Variable"` represents a variable.

Usage (API)
-----------

```javascript
var archetype = require('archetype')

archetype.generateFromDir('path/to/archetype/dir', 'path/to/destination/dir', {
    var1: value,
    "var 2": value
});
```

Destination dir does not have to be created beforehand. It should be empty, however, or files present in the directory will be overwritten.

License

**archetype** is released under the Apache license version 2. See LICENSE.txt for more details.
